# Dovetale — Website Architecture & UX Strategy

## 1. Website Strategic Purpose & Sitemap

   - **Placement:** Header (always visible), Hero section, and bottom closing banner of every page.
2. **Secondary Call to Action:**  
   - **Label:** `Explore Our Services` or `See How We Work`
   - **Destination:** `/services` or `/how-we-work`
   - **Placement:** Hero sub-buttons and mid-page contextual links.

## 5. Technical UX & Conversion Best Practices

- **Zero Clutter:** No intrusive popups, countdown timers, or irrelevant chatbot widgets.
- **Sub-2-Second Load Times:** Clean code, minimal JavaScript overhead, next-gen WebP/SVG images.
- **Sticky Mobile Action:** On mobile devices, a persistent floating footer bar ensures the contact CTA is accessible at all times without scrolling.
- **Contextual Form Validation:** Clear inline error messages and auto-formatting for phone numbers and email fields.
